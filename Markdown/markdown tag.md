**indent the element four spaces or one tab**,   
as shown in the following examples.

* This is the first list item.
* Here's the second list item.

    > A blockquote would look great below the second list item.

## Code Blocks

Code blocks are normally indented four spaces or one tab.   
When theyâ€™re in a list, indent them eight spaces or two tabs.

1. Open the file.
2. Find the following code block on line 21:

        <html>
          <head>
            <title>Test</title>
          </head>

3. Update the title to match the name of your website.


## Images

1. Open the file containing the Linux mascot.
2. Marvel at its beauty.

    ![Tux, the Linux mascot](./tux.png)

3. Close the file.

The rendered output looks like this:

    Open the file containing the Linux mascot.

    Marvel at its beauty.

    Tux, the Linux mascot
